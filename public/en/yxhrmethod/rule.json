{"content": "<p>The <a href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">Yahoo! Mail</a> team found that when using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, POST is implemented in the browsers as a two-step process: sending the headers first, then sending data. So it&rsquo;s best to use GET, which only takes one TCP packet to send (unless you have a lot of cookies). The maximum URL length in IE is 2K, so if you send more than 2K data you might not be able to use GET.</p><p>An interesting side affect is that POST without actually posting any data behaves like GET. Based on the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\">HTTP specs</a>, GET is meant for retrieving information, so it makes sense (semantically) to use GET when you&rsquo;re only requesting data, as opposed to sending data to be stored server-side.</p>", "id": "yxhrmethod", "title": "Use GET for AJAX Requests"}
