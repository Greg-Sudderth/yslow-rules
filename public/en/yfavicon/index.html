Make favicon.ico Small and Cacheable
images 
<p>The favicon.ico is an image that stays in the root of your server. It&rsquo;s a necessary evil because even if you don&rsquo;t care about it the browser will still request it, so it&rsquo;s better not to respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code>. Also since it&rsquo;s on the same server, cookies are sent every time it&rsquo;s requested. This image also interferes with the download sequence, for example in IE when you request extra components in the onload, the favicon will be downloaded before these extra components.</p>

<p>So to mitigate the drawbacks of having a favicon.ico make sure:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s small, preferably under 1K.</li>
<li>Set Expires header with what you feel comfortable (since you cannot rename it if you decide to change it). You can probably safely set the Expires header a few months in the future. You can check the last modified date of your current favicon.ico to make an informed decision.</li>
</ul>
