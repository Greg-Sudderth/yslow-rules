Reduce Cookie Size
<p>HTTP cookies are used for a variety of reasons such as authentication and personalization. Information about cookies is exchanged in the HTTP headers between web servers and browsers. It&rsquo;s important to keep the size of cookies as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user&rsquo;s response time.</p>

<p>For more information check <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/03/01/performance-research-part-3/">&ldquo;When the Cookie Crumbles&rdquo;</a> by Tenni Theurer and Patty Chi. The take-home of this research:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eliminate unnecessary cookies</li>
<li>Keep cookie sizes as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user response time</li>
<li>Be mindful of setting cookies at the appropriate domain level so other sub-domains are not affected</li>
<li>Set an Expires date appropriately. An earlier Expires date or none removes the cookie sooner, improving the user response time</li>
</ul>
