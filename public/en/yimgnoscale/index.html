Do Not Scale Images in HTML
<p>Don&rsquo;t use a bigger image than you need just because you can set the width and height in HTML. If you need <code>&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;mycat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Cat&quot; /&gt;</code> then your image (mycat.jpg) should be 100x100px rather than a scaled down 500x500px image.</p>
