Split Components Across Domains
content 
<p>Splitting components allows you to maximize parallel downloads. Make sure you&rsquo;re using not more than 2-4 domains because of the DNS lookup penalty. For example, you can host your HTML and dynamic content on <code>www.example.org</code> and split static components between <code>static1.example.org</code> and <code>static2.example.org</code></p>
